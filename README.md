# smartwindow

###Project Description:

The concept of our project is to predict how much air pollution there will be, depending on the weather and traffic. This is done based on air pollution data gathered from a sensor placed outside a bedroom window. These data will then be correlated to the weather and traffic data gathered from public sources. We will look at how these data; temperature, humidity, traffic emissions, will affect the air quality outside the bedroom window. Based on this we will develop a model that can be combined with both weather and traffic data to predict air quality in the area. Ideally, this can be used to alert the areaâ€™s inhabitants whenever air pollution is high. People can then decide when to open their windows based on the prediction.
